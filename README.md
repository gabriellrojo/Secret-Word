# The Challenge

Simulating an api in a .js file that contains an array of objects separated by categories, the system randomly chooses a word from that category which is also chosen randomly through a JS method. The user has up to 3 attempts to guess the chosen word.
From this project I was able to consolidate my knowledge in some ReactJs concepts.
